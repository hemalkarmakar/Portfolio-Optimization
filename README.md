# Portfolio-Optimization
This work was part of my academic project for course "Computational Finance" at Oklahoma State University. I started learning Python through this course and used it on various areas of Finance. 

I have constructed a Python class that reflects my learning throughout this course. 

This python class constructs portfolio of:
- maximum Sharpe ratio,
- minimum variance,
- minimum risk at a target return level,
- maximum Sharpe ratio at a target risk level &
- efficinet frontier.


** The sole purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of Python in Finance. The construction of the portfolio itself is not completely accurate, therefore, not suitable for making real investment decision **
