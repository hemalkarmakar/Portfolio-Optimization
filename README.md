# Portfolio-Optimization
This work was part of my academic project for course named "Computational Finance" at Oklahoma State University. This course was my first time learning Python and applying it in Finance.
I have constructed a Python class that reflects my learning throughout this course. 

This python class constructs portfolio of :
        - maximum Sharpe ratio,
        - minimum variance,
        - minimum risk at a target return level,
        - maximum Sharpe ratio at a target risk level &
        - efficnet frontier.
