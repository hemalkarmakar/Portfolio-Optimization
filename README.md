# Portfolio-Optimization
This work was part of my academic project for course "Computational Finance" at Oklahoma State University. I started learning Python through this course and used it on various areas of Finance. 

I have constructed a Python class that reflects my learning throughout this course. 

This python class constructs portfolio of :
        - maximum Sharpe ratio,
        - minimum variance,
        - minimum risk at a target return level,
        - maximum Sharpe ratio at a target risk level &
        - efficnet frontier.
